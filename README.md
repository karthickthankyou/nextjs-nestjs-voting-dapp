## Features

- **Upgradable Smart Contracts**: This project is built on the robust Ethereum blockchain, leveraging the power of Solidity for creating upgradable smart contracts. This ensures the application stays flexible, secure, and in tune with advancements in blockchain technologies.

- **Real-Time Blockchain Event Indexing**: I've designed the system to listen for blockchain events in real-time, index them, and make them easily accessible for further usage. This provides a powerful and reliable data foundation.

- **PostgreSQL and MeiliSearch Integration**: The application integrates with both PostgreSQL and MeiliSearch. This approach allows the robust and reliable data storage of PostgreSQL while taking advantage of MeiliSearch's full-text search capabilities with typo tolerance for an enhanced user experience.

- **Prisma ORM**: I've adopted Prisma, a modern and powerful ORM, for easy manipulation of data and to ensure a strong type-checking system.

- **Blockchain Access with Web3.js**: The front end has direct access to the blockchain through Web3.js, enabling the creation of rich, interactive user interfaces.

- **Pre-commit Code Validation**: The setup includes a pre-commit hook for code validation, helping to catch and fix issues before they are committed into the codebase. This maintains the overall quality and readability of the code.

- **UI Component Development with Storybook**: I develop and test UI components using Storybook, which allows creation of components in isolation and ensures they work correctly in every context.

- **Form Management with React Hook Form and Zod**: The application uses React Hook Form for efficient form management and Zod for schema validation, ensuring user data is correct and in the expected format.

- **Design System with Tailwind CSS**: I've established a custom design system built on top of Tailwind CSS. This approach offers complete control over the styling and maintains a consistent look and feel across the entire application.

- **Ready-Made Components from Material UI and Headless UI**: The application leverages the power of Material UI and Headless UI, using their ready-made components that have been adapted to fit the custom design system.

- **Code Generation Tools**: I've adopted code generation tools to automate the creation of components and GraphQL resources, thereby enhancing productivity and ensuring a standardized codebase.
